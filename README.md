# README

Welcome to Congro$$, a web application that aggregates multiple sources of data on the current members of
congress and makes it easy to understand for any user (regardless of political background). This app is
just getting started so please check back for issues and more on how to contribute.

This app is built with Rails 5 and will have an independent repo for a frontend application. More
to come on that shortly.

We are so happy to have multiple, already existing, sources of data mainly coming from ProPublica
https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/ and the FEC's new open API
https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/.

This project is also entirely open source, if you want to get involved just:

- Fork this repo
- Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
- Write Tests!
- Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature')
- Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
- Create new Pull Request
- That PR should be highly descriptive of the issue you are tackling and the steps you took to solve

This project was started by @AfroDevGirl as labor of love. If you have any questions, comments, concerns
you can send her an email at amoodyldes@gmail.com
